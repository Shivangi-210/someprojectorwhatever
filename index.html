<h2>I do not know what to do. I feel so unprepared for my own bday :'(</h2>
<h3>This is not what i was supposed to do in my project but i am doing it anyways  :)</h3>
<p>So ya in this project i am going to give you a brief speech or whatever about me :)</p>
<br> <br>
<p id="me">Hi my name is Shivangi Maheshwari and currently i am 11 years old. My birthday is on 25th of September. My zodiac sign is a Libra. My fav color is Blue. I love blue and pink :) and also purple. My fav no. is 8 :) My fav zodiac sign is Scorpio. My bff's zodiac is Scorpio. Many people who like zodiacs and stuff think that scorpi is not a good sign. But actually you are wrong scorpio is literally a good sign. People say that scorpio's are very jelous and they are not good like at all. Have you ever imagined being a scorpio and listening to people who say bad about your sign? And also knowing that you are the second most hated sign? Scorpios' are caring, loving, and they are really really good. Some people would be like "why would a Libra defend a scorpio? what is special about scorpios? They are just like the scorpions" nope they are not like scorpions. google says"    Scorpios are known for being tough-minded and biting, but they also have lots of positive qualities that make them great friends and successful people overall." anyways i have said a lot about scorpios and if you still decide to not like them it is your loss :). I am a bts army :). And i love jk :). My fav elements are air and water. I ove art (not my art other's) Art is a really good way of expressing somethings. When I grow up and earn money I would love to have a penthouse with a pool and a roomie cuz i am scared of ghostsss and think about a ghost in the penthouse :0 nowhere to run from it :0. so imma also buy another apt (apartment) with a roomie duh! I am on roblox i mostly play royale high it is a good game I really really wanna earn some dims (diamonds is the currency in rh (royale high)) I have spent more than 50k on worthless junks like butterfly heels and a true royale high staple a skirt and the cheapest heels whivh is 14k dims :( so ya imma trade all all all of it for dims in the trading hub when i am lvl 75 i am lvl 64ish so ya. ig thats all i wanna say? if yall wanna play royale high with me scroll down and i would give you my username in roblox but do know that if you are offline and do not pay with me imma unfriend you :) byee  </p>
<br> <br> <br><br> <br> <br> <br> <p>do note that i wanted my project to be in colors but idk why there aren't any colors in this so ya :')</p><br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 
<div><p> So my username is "Shivangi_army08" 
    Some tips to lvl up in rh are :- 
    1. Play everyday 
    2. Computer loging in the apartments to get diamonds 
    3. Play sunset island if you want so diamonds easily 
    4. Play Royale high new campus or classic campus which ever suits you the best. 
    5. Take books to all your classes 
    6.  DO NOT ! DO NOT BUY FOOD DURING BREAKFAST AND LUNCH IT COSTS YOU DIAMONDS!
    7. Do all the things like in art class paint the canvas like the picture given, in eng class choose the correct spelling,  and in chem class choose the correct potion.
    8. After your energy is 0 or less than 50 teleport to your apt and sleep. 
    9. Do the lucky spin 
    10. lastly do the fountaind of dreams in divinia park but be aware it can give you diamonds and also take diamonds too so choose the correct option based on the story
    thats all from me hope we play soon byee have a nice day and thank you for seeing my project :)
